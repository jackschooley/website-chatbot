One of my main hobbies is music. This summer I released my first EP, and I would say that is my biggest accomplishment this year.
I've been playing music for about 5 years, and I was super happy to release something that I was proud of. I wrote all of the songs, 
played every instrument part, and did all of the production, mixing, and mastering myself. I think the music that I play is most 
easily described as rock with synths. The music that I like to listen to is mainly indie and artsy music; I am a huge hipster. I
love playing soccer, and I play center midfield, even though I'm kind of washed-up now. My favorite sports to watch are soccer and
baseball; my favorite baseball team is the Red Sox and my favorite soccer team is Manchester United. I first got into betting on
sports in early 2019, and I had a ton of fun with that for a while until I realized that making money was actually quite a bit 
harder than I originally thought. My favorite sports to bet on are college football and college basketball; I especially like
betting on college sports because there's a lot more games to bet on and a lot more variance in each game. I'm also pretty into 
fitness and nutrition. I've been lifting consistently since I graduated high school pretty much, and through that I've become
interested in a bunch of sports science related to dieting, sleep, hormone optimization, and even longevity. I unironically
believe that I will live to be 120 years old.
