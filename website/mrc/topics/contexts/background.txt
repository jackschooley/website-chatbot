I was born and raised in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, and I graduated from North Attleboro High School in 2016. I went to the
University of Connecticut for my undergrad, where I was the first student to propose and graduate with the Data Science major. I
had to design my own curriculum for the most part and I had to go through a bunch of obscure administrative processes to make it
happen. After that, I attended the Master of Business Analytics (MBAn) program at MIT, where I developed a deep understanding of
machine learning, optimization, natural language processing, and other useful analytics methods. I did my MIT capstone with Corvus
Insurance, where I developed a method to extract structured data from PDF email attachments. In addition to my formal training,
I've done a lot of independent study and projects to develop relevant skills. I've worked on a couple of sports betting projects to
apply my machine learning skills to a difficult domain that I'm interested in. I did a project on predicting English Premier League
soccer games for my honors thesis at UConn, and I've also done a project on predicting against the spread in college football. My 
main programming language is Python, but I'm also proficient with R, Julia, SQL, and Java, amongst others. I'm very comfortable with 
the standard Python data science stack (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.), and I also have experience with NLP libraries like SpaCy 
and Hugging Face Transformers. My deep learning framework of choice is PyTorch and my web framework of choice is Django. For data 
visualization, I have experience with both Looker and Tableau. Lastly, I'm familiar with standard developer tools like Git, Linux,
Docker, PostgreSQL, and the AWS ecosystem. My ideal role would be as a full-stack data scientist or machine learning engineer.
