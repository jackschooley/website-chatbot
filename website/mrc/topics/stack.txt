This website is almost entirely built with Python and its various libraries. The machine learning model is a Machine Reading
Comprehension model built with PyTorch. The model is a deep neural network that uses a transformer (DistilBERT from the Hugging Face
transformers library, in particular) as its encoder along with decoder modules.
